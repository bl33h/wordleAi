# wordleAi
## Description
This project is designed to simulate the Wordle game, where players guess a five-letter word within six tries. The project includes two solving models: Constraints and Minimax, to analyze their performance in solving the game.

## Features
- **Wordle Game Simulation**: Play the Wordle game with a maximum of 6 guesses.
- **Constraints Model**: Uses constraint satisfaction techniques to solve the game.
- **Minimax Model**: Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal solution finding.
- **Performance Analysis**: Visualize and compare the success rate, total time, and accuracy of different models.
- **Graphical Representations**: Generate graphs to compare model performances.
